==========

Eminent Perception on .Net, is a web application framework that allows developers to quickly build applications in .Net. With Perception you can build your applications on Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server databases. We've used Perception to build applications for the US Military and decided to make it available to other entripise Microsoft developers. The platform comes with all of the libraries you need to build every aspect of your application. It's like Twitter bootstrap but for backend development.
